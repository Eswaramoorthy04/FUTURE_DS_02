# Social Media Campaign Analysis & Dashboard

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze simulated data from a social media ad campaign to uncover key performance insights. This was achieved by cleaning the data, creating analytical measures using DAX, and building an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data modeling, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.  
- **DAX**: For creating custom measures and KPIs.  

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Corrected data types for fields such as `reporting_start`.  
   - Handled inconsistencies within the dataset to ensure accuracy.  

2. **Data Modeling**:  
   - Built a relational data model to connect different tables.  
   - Created a dedicated measures table for better organization of KPIs.  

3. **DAX Measures**:  
   - Developed key metrics such as Total Impressions, Total Clicks, CTR (Click-Through Rate), and ROI (Return on Investment).  

4. **Dashboard Creation**:  
   - Designed a user-friendly, interactive dashboard.  
   - Enabled dynamic filtering by demographics like age and gender.  

## Key Insights
- **Campaign Performance**: Provides an overview of overall campaign trends over time.  
- **Demographic Performance**: Identifies which age groups and genders had the highest engagement and conversion rates.  
- **Ad-Level Insights**: Highlights the most effective ad campaigns and interests driving results.  

## How to Use
1. Open the Power BI `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.  
2. Interact with the dashboard by applying filters for demographics, time periods, or campaigns.  
3. Explore the insights using the visualizations and KPIs to understand campaign performance.
